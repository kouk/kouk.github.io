<blockquote><p>
Oh, it all had to come about the way it came to be<br />
That hopes and roses withered<br />
That, like boats, the years left me<br />
Left and faded away</p>
<p>That, like we would part at night<br />
So many friends forever were lost<br />
The place where as a child I grew<br />
One afternoon I left behind</p>
<p>The pretty, simple girls - oh loves! -<br />
Life was to take away - dance whirl<br />
Even the pain, once fragrant,<br />
Was to bear barren upon me.</p>
<p>All of it had to happen. Only the night<br />
Wasn't to be so sweet<br />
The stars there blinking like eyes<br />
As if laughing at me.</p>
<p>Nipenthi, 1921
