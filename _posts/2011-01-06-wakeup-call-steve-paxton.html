<blockquote><p>
I think that one of the reasons I got involved in dance<br />
is to finish my movement development.<br />
Because I have a hunger to find,<br />
and to finish,<br />
and to explore,<br />
to do essentially what babies do when they begin to move.<br />
A hunger to find out more of what movement is or can be.<br />
I think it provides a service to keep the search alive<br />
in a culture,<br />
which has engineered an environment which requires physical and sensorial suppression to exist in.<br />
Most of the people who study dance aren't ambitious to be dancers, in fact.<br />
Or aren't serious about that ambition.<br />
I think they're trying to complete physicality<br />
that gets messed up by sitting for 12 years in school, or longer.<br />
Essentially, urban civilization has cut off from movement and sensorial development which would occur in a natural environment.<br />
I mean the sense of smell is leaving.<br />
The sense of sight is rigidly controlled by readings,<br />
by television,<br />
by school,<br />
by signage,<br />
by words everywhere in the city.<br />
In fact there are many kinds of of control or implicit visual message<br />
about how to interact with the city.<br />
Here there is more neon than nuance.<br />
Food is advertised rather than hunted for.<br />
Entertainment becomes divorced from ingenuity.<br />
I'm not complaining because it is about 15,000 years too late to change direction.<br />
I have found the cities very interesting places,<br />
but when I return to the country I am struck by the difference in what is required by the senses.<br />
It is appalling how we disuse the body.<br />
Dance remind us about that.<br />
Dance explores some of the physical possibilities.<br />
Dance refocuses our focusing mind on very basic existence,<br />
and time, space, gravity, open up to creativity.<br />
This seems to me a reminder of nature, of our natures,<br />
and as such it provides a service to us in our physical doldrums.<br />
It is a wakeup call to deadened urbanites,<br />
a stimulus, to work-habituated bodies,<br />
a promise to developing children...
