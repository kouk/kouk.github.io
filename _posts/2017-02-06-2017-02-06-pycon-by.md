## PyCon Belarus 2017

This weekend I had the opportunity to attend [PyCon Belarus](http://by.pycon.org/) as a speaker. Shout-out to Maya, Dimitris and Nikos at [Transifex](https://transifex.com), Alina, Katja and Yulia from [EventSpace.by](http://eventspace.by/), and all the other people involved for making it happen!

My talk was called _"Going global with Python"_, and you can see the [slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EOe0KHOPwX35JFj5ewX-JgNHJxOBFE7wWNFEbCUTMPE/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000&slide=id.g236391c17530979a_57). It's the first time I actually speak in public about this topic, but I think it went well. 

Various people approached me after to thank me or ask questions. Overall I would say it was a pretty interesting bunch of people attending, and I managed to get a lot out of the conference despite many of the talks and discussions being in Russian. Some interesting talks that I found the slides for included [_Queue with
asyncio and Kafka_](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I1tMVrnoY1BABxLC7QWrGsSd8UTQFvtOjE9nSxCy-dA/edit#slide=id.g20ca561b34_0_1) by [Ondřej Veselý](https://twitter.com/xorwen), [_The What and Why of Python and Elasticsearch_](http://slides.com/honzakral/what-and-why-of-python-elasticsearch#/) by [Honza Kral](https://twitter.com/honzakral), and [_Python 3.6 &
Performance_](http://igordavydenko.com/talks/by-pycon-2017/) by [Igor Davydenko](https://twitter.com/playpausenstop).

Last, I had the pleasure of walking around the city of Minsk which was very beautifull, dressed in white. One thing I liked in particular was the [street art on Кастрычніцкая (Kastryčnickaja) street](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNQAqiHPVKFROCYuuNzWX1fj_0vOl2VpBe7bVUz-X-I2iiznhdJaTjz07UrMCls-g?key=TG5qSnIzQl9rd3M3WFFxZXpvcGxCQWFFZWZZRXRB). 

Definitely recommended for next year!
