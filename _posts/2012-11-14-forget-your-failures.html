<p>Sometimes we are attached to our failures as much as to our successes. After all, our failures are our own creations as well. And while we are tormented by them, we also feel pain when someone lends us a helping hand, shows us a path to their amendment or, heaven forbid, tells us the truth: that our failures were creations with a purpose, and actually quite successful. What purpose does a failure have? To hide something even more uncomfortable to us, ourselves. This can be especially the case if, confronted with our failures, we flee from other people in anger or in sadness. We flee especially from those who love us, a tragedy for both them and us.</p>
