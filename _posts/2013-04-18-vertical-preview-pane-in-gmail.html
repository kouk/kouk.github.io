<p>I'm trying out <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/94984/gmail-labs-rolls-out-preview-pane/">this lab</a>, perhaps late to the party but anyway. I kind of like it, especially the vertical split. </p>
<p>My 2 issues: I use the keyboard shortcuts j,k to view or select the next or previous message respectively. This works fine, although I would prefer that the cursor moved without actually opening the next or previous message. I could use the 'o' keyboard shortcut to actually view the message. The actual problem I have is that when the cursor goes below the end of the viewport the list of messages doesn't scroll. Any one have any idea about a workaround?</p>
<p>(using google chrome)</p>
