## Finally moved the blog to jekyll, hosted on GitHub pages

It was a long time I wanted to do this, so finally it's done. The blog is now hosted on GitHub pages, and is displayed using Jekyll. The import from [kouk.wordpress.com](http://kouk.wordpress.com) went fine, disqus integration works, although some shortcodes still need fixing (like youtube videos). I like the new theme!
