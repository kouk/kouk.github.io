<p>[caption id="attachment_95" align="alignright" width="225" caption="Athens Airways Checkin"]<img src="assets/imgp03382.jpg?w=225" alt="Athens Airways Checkin" title="Athens Airways Checkin" width="225" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-95" />[/caption]
<p>Today I flew to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mytilene">Mitilini</a> for the weekend on the new regional airline in Greece, <a href="http://www.athensairways.com/">Athens Airways</a>. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I couldn't take pictures onboard because I forgot the camera in the overhead compartment and we weren't allowed to get up because of turbulence.</p>
<p>There was a cloud of mud (sand and rain) in the air as we lifted up out of Athens. There were also strong winds in Athens so take-off was very bumby and swervy, I felt kid of nauseous.</p>
<p>The aircraft was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embraer_ERJ_145_family">EMBRAER ERJ-145</a> named "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Engonopoulos">Νίκος Εγγονόπουλος</a>" after the greek painter. It has 49 seats, three to a row, one on the left, two on the right. The cabin ceiling was extremely low for me, I just couldn't sit up straight anywhere! But the seats had good leg room (well I was in the emergency exit seat and with no one sitting next to me). Athens Airways currently has 4 of these aircraft at the moment, all named after greek painters.</p>
<p>Each seat was equipped with a bottle of mineral water, a <a href="http://www.coco-mat.com/">coco-mat</a> pillow, a coco-mat cloth envelope containing 1 kit-kat chocolate, 1 unidentified candy and a wet towel scented with chamomile. With the exception of the low ceiling everything was stylish and comfortable overall.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there was too much turbulence to serve beverages. Also I don't know if it was related to the turbulence but the stewardess didn't let me use my laptop after take-off.</p>
<p>The weather in Mitilini was windy, 25 knots. The approach was very bumpy, and if i wasn't looking outside the window constantly I would have been sick. The pilot did a very good job though and got us to the airport. Honestly I thought he would have turned around and headed back to Athens. There was a big applause from the passengers once we were taxiing down he runway :-)</p>
<h4>Update on the 6th of March 2009</h4>
<p>On my return flight today there was fine weather so I got served some <a href="http://kouk.tumblr.com/post/84853647/food-and-beverages-aboard-athens-airways-flight-zf">beverages</a> and managed to take some pictures of the <a href="http://kouk.tumblr.com/post/84854243/seats-of-an-embraer-erj-145">plane</a> and the <a href="http://brightkite.com/objects/74c3848a0c9f11debd99003048c0801e">view of Mitilini</a> and <a href="http://brightkite.com/objects/8d0514820c9f11de91ec003048c0801e">Lesvos from above</a>.</p>
