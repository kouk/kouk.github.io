<p>Ok, I've heard about map producers incorporating mistakes in their data to identify copies, but this goes too far: </p>
<p>[googlemaps http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=37.981238,23.735168&amp;spn=0.006461,0.007027&amp;msid=115435869406637961092.00046a7b5659a8aff4795&amp;output=embed&amp;w=425&amp;h=350]</p>
<p>What? Can't spot the mistake? And you call yourself an athenian? :-)</p>
<p>Anyway, according to <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> (or more accurately according to <a href="http://www.teleatlas.com">Tele Atlas</a>) in the center of Athens there are <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=<br />
115435869406637961092.00046a7b5659a8aff4795">two streets, side by side, called "Akadimias"</a>. Of course anyone having spent a few weeks in Athens must know <a href="http://www.mlahanas.de/Greece/Cities/Athens/AkadimiasStreet.html">Akadimias street</a>.</p>
<p>Actually the north-eastern street that, according to Google, is named "Akadimias" is called "Solonos" and is also very important to know if you live in Athens. Searching for <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=solonos+athens">Solonos athens</a> brings up plenty of places on that street that correctly report their address as Solonos str. But you can't find the street itself. Here's how it should be:</p>
