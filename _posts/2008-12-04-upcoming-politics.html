<p>I have recently and improbably been involved in politics. Procrastination permitting, this site will see soon contain posts about my involvement in politics. </p>
<p>Obviously I'm assuming that there are people interested in my political activities, which is not such a stretch as it might seem (remember we're on the internet). It also seems likely that at least those same people will have some use <a href="#fnote1" id="ref1">(<sup>1</sup>)</a> for my thoughts and references to political theory and practice.</p>
<p>So, in anticipation of more substantial posts <a href="#fnote2" id="ref2">(<sup>2</sup>)</a> on politics, may I just point to [wikipedia entries on] a few political schools that are relevant to what's ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism">Classical liberalism</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism">Libertarianism</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualist_anarchism">Individualist anarchism</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a id="fnote1" href="#ref1">1</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment#Comedy">entertainment</a> is an acceptable use.<br />
<a id="fnote2" href="#ref2">2</a>. the present post is pretty unsubstantial but at least it serves the purpose of adding some tags, like 'libertarian', to the tag cloud that I'm fidgeting with at the moment.</p>
