<p>I subscribe to <a href="http://www.canarie.ca/~bstarn/">Bill St. Arnaud</a>'s <a href="http://lists.canarie.ca/mailman/listinfo/news">CA*net 4 News mailing list</a> (he's got a <a href="http://billstarnaud.blogspot.com">blog too</a>). Bill works at <a href="http://www.canarie.ca/about/index.html">CANARIE Inc.</a> which operates <a href="http://www.canarie.ca/canet4/">CA*net</a>, the world's first national optical Internet research and education network (est. 1998 ) in Canada. At first I subscribed to learn more about different models of fiber ownership, specifically home-owned fiber, although now there seems to be a shift in his interested more towards <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture"><abbr title="Service Oriented Architecture">SOA</abbr></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">cloud computing</a> and zero-carbon IT services. Which is also interesting of course. From a look at <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/10944250645575421057">his blogger profile</a> he has a host of other interests, like in <a href="http://next-generation-democracy.blogspot.com/">e-democracy</a>.</p>
<p>His usual thesis is that IT can go zero-carbon by locating virtualization and cloud commodity services at places <a href="http://iceland.ednet.ns.ca/schedule.htm">like this</a>. Impending regulations like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_trading">cap and trade</a> are thought to provide economic incentives for this (there have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/22/AR2007072200884.html?hpid=opinionsbox2">been</a> <a href="http://www.reason.com/blog/show/131338.html">many</a> <a href="http://www.american.com/archive/2008/november-11-08/the-problem-with-a-2018cap-and-trade2019-system">criticisms</a> of these systems btw). Today <a href="http://emperor.canarie.ca/pipermail/news/2009/000672.html">Bill sent out</a> an article that <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/02/13/1852241">appeared on Slashdot</a> as well that refers to a UC Berkeley research paper paper called <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-28.pdf">"Above the Clouds: A Berkeley View of Cloud Computing" (pdf)</a> which corroborates his thesis on economical terms. The paper's main task is listing the main obstacles to cloud computing success, which, according to the researchers, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Availability of service</li>
<li>Data lock-in</li>
<li>Data confidentiality and auditability</li>
<li>Data transfer bottlenecks</li>
<li>Performance unpredictability</li>
<li>Scalable storage</li>
<li>Bugs in large distributed systems (author's note: anyone working with grids knows how true this is)</li>
<li>Scaling quickly</li>
<li>Reputation fate sharing</li>
<li>Software licensing</li>
</ul>
<p>As Bill says in his posting, reliability is a problem for zero or low carbon emission cloud services, since cloud computing must be geographical distributed to be reliable, but you can't find low-emission-and-cost energy everywhere.</p>
<p>Here are some some figures about energy production cost that Bill cites from the paper:</p>
<table>
<caption>Price of kilowatt-hours of electricity by region</caption>
<tr>
<th>Price per KWH</th>
<th>Source</th>
<th>Possible reasons why</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.6¢</td>
<td>Idaho Hydroelectric power</td>
<td>not sent long distance</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10.0¢</td>
<td>California Electricity</td>
<td>transmitted long distance over the grid;<br />
limited transmission lines in Bay Area; no coal<br />
fired electricity allowed in California.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>18.0¢</td>
<td>Hawaii</td>
<td>Must ship fuel to generate electricity</td>
</tr>
