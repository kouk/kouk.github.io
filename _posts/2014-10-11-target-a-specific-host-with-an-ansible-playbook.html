<p>Sometime you have a playbook that's all like:</p>
<p>{% highlight yaml %}
---
- hosts: all
...
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>and in your inventory you've got a long list of hosts that <code>all</code> would expand to. What if you want to just run the playbook for one or two hosts? Then <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/18199029">tip by Tybstar</a> is valuable, because you can apparently just add a comma separated list of host names instead of an inventory file name. If you only want one host just add a comma after the name:</p>
<p>{% highlight bash %}
ansible-playbook -i 'localhost' playbook.yml
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>As you can see this comes in handy if you just want to run a playbook against localhost.</p>
