<p>Hello 2014. Let's see, will I succeed in keeping a journal like I've promised myself many times before? "This time it's different", right? Well is it? Yes, at least in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will <del datetime="2014-01-06T08:55:58+00:00">publicize</del> publish at least two entries a week on my blog. At least, while in between I may keep private entries or not.</li>
<li>The handwritten paper should also be published alongside the text. Yes it's a bit of extra work but maybe it will help me with my handwriting, and also appeal to some readers who are hipsters like me :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>But why keep a journal in the first place? Well I think that the struggle to find the right words to say something is fruitfull in many ways. Writing is  a Great technology, capital G. But in the process you learn a lot about what you know and what you are. An extra reason to keep a journal is as an exercise in discipline. Kind of like getting up in the morning and going running, you win just by exiting the house. So I could stop right here I suppose and chalk one up.</p>
<p>The empty page however beckons.</p>
<p>My thoughts on the new year are a bit unclear. All through the previous year I had been planning that it would be great in a a particular way. Now, the particulars are wiped away and I have to improvise. Lesson #1 don't dream about particulars, have broader dreams. The major particular that I was dreaming of was my girlfriend moving in with me, and our relationship progressing to new heights. Instead, under the fog of this all important goal, reality brought a sudden and painfull breakup between Christmas and New Years. Don't ignore reality, it'll bite you like a feral dog.</p>
<p>The upshot is I can focus more easily on <a title="The Longaccess company" href="http://www.longaccess.com">the new job</a>, which I'm excited about and have (broad) hopes about :-D</p>
<p>Here's to an exciting and productive new year for all of you!</p>
